### **Types of Collections in Kotlin**

Kotlin provides various collection types to manage and manipulate data. Each type is classified based on whether it is mutable (modifiable) or immutable (non-modifiable).

#### 1. **List**:

- Ordered collection of elements.
- Elements can be accessed by their **index**.
- Immutable by default (`listOf`).

#### 2. **MutableList**:

- A modifiable version of `List`.
- Can add, remove, or update elements dynamically.

#### 3. **Set**:

- A collection of **unique elements**.
- Immutable by default (`setOf`).
- Does **not allow duplicates**, ensuring all elements are distinct.

#### 4. **MutableSet**:

- A modifiable version of `Set`.
- Can add or remove elements dynamically.

#### 5. **Map**:

- A collection of **key-value pairs**.
- Keys must be **unique**.
- Immutable by default (`mapOf`).

#### 6. **MutableMap**:

- A modifiable version of `Map`.
- Keys and values can be added, updated, or removed.

### **Set Example**

A `Set` in Kotlin is a generic collection of unique elements. The example below demonstrates a `Set` of Strings:

```kotlin
val computer: Set<String> = setOf(
    "Mark 4",
    "Personal computer",
    "Tablet",
    "Cell phone"
)
```

- This `Set` contains four unique elements.
- It is immutable and ensures no duplicate entries.

### **Map Example**

Maps are collections that store data in **key-value pairs**. The keys must be unique, but the values can be duplicated. A common example might map strings to integers, like:

```kotlin
val nameToAge: Map<String, Int> = mapOf(
    "Alice" to 30,
    "Bob" to 25,
    "Charlie" to 35
)
```

### **ForEach, Map, and Filter Operations**

Kotlin collections provide powerful operations for iterating, transforming, and filtering data. Letâ€™s dive into each one:

#### **ForEach**:

- Iterates through each element in a collection.
- Example:

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
numbers.forEach { println(it) }
```

Output:

```
1
2
3
4
```

#### **Map**:

- Applies a transformation function to each element in the collection.
- Creates a new collection with the transformed values.
- Example:

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
val squared = numbers.map { it * it }
println(squared)  // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

#### **Filter**:

- Filters elements based on a condition.
- Returns a new collection containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.
- Example:

```kotlin
val cookies = listOf(Cookie("Choco", true), Cookie("Oatmeal", false))
val softBakedMenu = cookies.filter { it.softBaked }
println(softBakedMenu)  // Output: [Cookie(name=Choco, softBaked=true)]
```

---

### **GroupBy**: Transforming a List into a Map

The `groupBy` function is used to group elements in a list into a map based on a condition or property.

- Example:

```kotlin
val cookies = listOf(
    Cookie("Choco", true),
    Cookie("Oatmeal", false),
    Cookie("Sugar", true)
)

val groupedMenu = cookies.groupBy { it.softBaked }
val softBakedMenu = groupedMenu[true] ?: listOf()
val crunchyMenu = groupedMenu[false] ?: listOf()

println("Soft cookies:")
softBakedMenu.forEach { println("${it.name} - $${it.price}") }

println("Crunchy cookies:")
crunchyMenu.forEach { println("${it.name} - $${it.price}") }
```

Output:

```
Soft cookies:
Choco - $2.5
Sugar - $1.5
Crunchy cookies:
Oatmeal - $3.0
```

Here, the list of cookies is grouped by whether they are soft-baked or crunchy.

### **Fold**: Reducing a Collection to a Single Value

The `fold` function reduces a collection to a single value by applying an operation on each element along with an accumulator.

- **Accumulator**: The intermediate result that is carried forward during the reduction.
    
- **Base Case**: The initial value of the accumulator.
    
- Example:
    

```kotlin
val cookies = listOf(
    Cookie("Choco", true, 2.5),
    Cookie("Oatmeal", false, 3.0),
    Cookie("Sugar", true, 1.5)
)

val totalPrice = cookies.fold(0.0) { total, cookie ->
    total + cookie.price
}
println("Total Price: $totalPrice")  // Output: 7.0
```

Here, `fold` calculates the sum of the prices of all cookies.

---

### **SortedBy**: Sorting a Collection

The `sortedBy` function sorts elements in a collection based on a property or condition.

- Example:

```kotlin
val cookies = listOf(
    Cookie("Choco", true, 2.5),
    Cookie("Oatmeal", false, 3.0),
    Cookie("Sugar", true, 1.5)
)

val alphabeticalMenu = cookies.sortedBy { it.name }
alphabeticalMenu.forEach { println(it.name) }
```

Output:

```
Choco
Oatmeal
Sugar
```

The cookies are sorted alphabetically based on their names.

### **Key Concepts Recap**

1. Kotlin collections are categorized into mutable and immutable types.
2. Powerful operations like `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `groupBy`, `fold`, and `sortedBy` simplify data manipulation.
3. Collections can be transformed and reduced to derive meaningful insights and results.
