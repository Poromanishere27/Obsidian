  THE PROBABILITY SET-UP
  The following definition of a-field is needed to put the theolY on sound  foundation. In our course, we typically take F to be set of all subsets of  the sample space S so that all the conditions are automatically satisfied.
  Definition ( a-field)  A collection F of sets in S is called a a-field if  (i) Both J. S are in F,
  (iii) if
  . are in F, then A, and A, are in F.
  Now, we are ready to introduce the notion of probability of an e  denoted by P(E). First we state the axioms that we want the noti  probability to be satisfied.
  Probability axioms

If two events are two events 
$$
P(E \cup F ) = P (E) + P(F) -P(E \cap F)

$$

Samples spaces in which the outcomes are equally likely  are called uniform sample spaces.
The following is our mai toll in computing probablities of events in the uniform space 

If S is a uniform sampalese and E is any event is 

$$
P(E) = \frac{\mbox{Number of outcomes in E}}{\mbox{Number of Outcomes in S}}

Example 2 Two cards are select at random from a standard deck of playing cards what is the proablity that 
- they are both aces
- neither of them is an ace
- exactly one of them is an ace.
Answers:
- $$\frac{1}{221}$$
- $$ \frac{1128}{1326}$$
- $$\frac{4(48)}{1326}$$
A group of 5 people is selected at random. What is the probability that at least two of them have the same birthday?

The total outcum is (365)^5
$$
P(\mbox {at least two have same bday})= 1-P
$$

In a survey of 200 people that just viisted Europe
- 142 visited UK
- 95 visited Italy
- 65 visited Germany
- 70 visited both UK and Italy
- 50 visited UK and Germany
- 30 visited Italy and Germany
- 20 visited all

If 3 marbles are randomly drwan from a blowl containg 6 red and 5 blue what is the proablity that one is red and two are blue.
$$
n(s)= {11\choose 3}
$$
The number of ways choosing 1 red and two blues is 
$$
{6 \choose 1} \times {5 \choose 2} 
$$
Thus 
$$
\frac {{6 \choose 1} \times {5 \choose 2} }{{11\choose 3}} = \frac{6 \times 10}{165} = \frac {60}{165}= \frac {4}{11}
$$
