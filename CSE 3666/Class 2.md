What are digital systems?
Ability to represent and manipulate discrete elements and information
- Discreet information -> represented by physical quantiles called signals- such as voltages

- The digital electronics is baes on two voltage levels- binary logic.

The digits in a binary numbers are called bits

When a bit is equal to 0 it does not contribute to the sum.

Arithmetic
When a vase other than the familiar base 10 is used, one be careful only the r-allowable digits.
1+1 =2
in binary: 1 +1 = 10
